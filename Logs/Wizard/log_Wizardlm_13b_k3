He was abrasive, obstinate, and arrogant. As punishment for his bad behavior, he was frequently relegated to desk duty and taking care of plants in the greenhouse. 
However, Raven was able to mold Donar into a dependable and patient member of the Esper Union over time. 
During an important mission in which Raven was not there to lead, Donar did not charge blindly to the front but instead waited to observe and assess the situation. He took action only when the necessary safety precautions were taken.
Although his interactions with his co-workers may be less than ideal, and his towering and gruff exterior makes him appear slightly intimidating, he is a nice person at heart. He has been known to lend a helping hand to those in need.
But when he is faced with enemies, he is able to handle threats calmly and without emotion, regardless of how powerful or many the adversaries are.
Only when he is complimented by his friends does Donar show a semblance of bashfulness, and a bit of awkwardness will arise.
For the first time, Donar was able to gain the acceptance of his peers after that particular assignment, and he began to self-reflect. Instead of focused solely on himself, he began to prioritize the team's interests before his own. 
Donar's fourth curriculum vitae is: Despite the fact that following the rules was never Donar's strong point, he was promoted to Commander and given extra responsibilities. 
He used to charge into the fray without a second's hesitation, but he has since tempered his impulsive tendencies in favor of more measured approaches.

 Donar is an alternate name for Thor, derived from the Old High German word for 'thunder'. It is used to refer to the same Norse god of thunder, lightning, and storms. 
========= 


=======source========
Donar's hero god name is Thor. Donar's age is 28. Donar's career is Commanding Presence. Donar's hobby is Working Out. Donar's organization is Dawn. 
Donar's first curriculum vitae is: Donar's bombastic approach to dealing with problems may occasionally result in minor issues or misunderstandings among his colleagues due to his boisterous and informal demeanor. 
Employees at the Esper Union have reported to the Human Resources department about his behavior on numerous occasions.
For the first time, Donar was able to gain the acceptance of his peers after that particular assignment, and he began to self-reflect. Instead of focused solely on himself, he began to prioritize the team's interests before his own. 
Donar's fourth curriculum vitae is: Despite the fact that following the rules was never Donar's strong point, he was promoted to Commander and given extra responsibilities. 
He used to charge into the fray without a second's hesitation, but he has since tempered his impulsive tendencies in favor of more measured approaches.
Although his interactions with his co-workers may be less than ideal, and his towering and gruff exterior makes him appear slightly intimidating, he is a nice person at heart. He has been known to lend a helping hand to those in need.
But when he is faced with enemies, he is able to handle threats calmly and without emotion, regardless of how powerful or many the adversaries are.
Only when he is complimented by his friends does Donar show a semblance of bashfulness, and a bit of awkwardness will arise.

But when he is faced with enemies, he is able to handle threats calmly and without emotion, regardless of how powerful or many the adversaries are.
Only when he is complimented by his friends does Donar show a semblance of bashfulness, and a bit of awkwardness will arise.
He began to question the meaning of being an Esper Union hero, and it took him a long time to sort out his thoughts. 
Though he is far from faultless, his allies unanimously agree that he is the best and most dependable commander they could possibly ask for. Donar's heroic ability is: Donar is a powerful Fighter who can convert DEF into damage.
Thundercrack (passive) turns Donar into a conductor which unleashes the power of thunder at the start of the next turn, dealing heavy damage to all enemies.
He was abrasive, obstinate, and arrogant. As punishment for his bad behavior, he was frequently relegated to desk duty and taking care of plants in the greenhouse. 
However, Raven was able to mold Donar into a dependable and patient member of the Esper Union over time. 
During an important mission in which Raven was not there to lead, Donar did not charge blindly to the front but instead waited to observe and assess the situation. He took action only when the necessary safety precautions were taken.

The Esper Union excelled at combating the Miramon threat. But, when dealing with lawbreakers and criminals, it was hampered by its own self-imposed rules and procedures. 
Crime and misconduct were often overlooked in these gray areas.
Although Lu Yi recognized that the Union needed to uphold regulations agreed upon with local authorities, he hated allowing criminals to escape due to technicalities. 
He ultimately decided not to join the Esper Union and to forge his own path to uphold justice.
To her, the Esper Union will always be a group of self-serving do-gooders that can’t be relied upon.
Under their supposed leadership, the Miracle threat has not lessened, and more and more lives are lost each year to Miramon attacks.
In order to save the world, more drastic measures need to be taken.
Jeanne has found like-minded individuals in the Shadow Decree, people who are willing to go to any length to save humanity from extinction.
Unlike other Espers, her decision to join the Shadow Decree had nothing to do with the world’s power struggles. She merely believed that the Shadow Decree was the best place to conduct her Esper transformation experiments without interference. 
Although Hyde promised to allow her to continue her research without restriction, he began to regret his decision almost immediately.

All of the divine powers in the world couldn’t help her out of her predicament. 
Isolated, alone, and facing accusations from all sides, Lin found help in the form of Luo Yan. Together, they were able to prove her innocence and earn her freedom.

Determined to expand her horizons, she chose to follow Luo Yan into the world outside the fighting pits.

If you have the patience to interact with Falken, you will discover that he is a very amicable person. His allies and colleagues have complete faith in him.
Although he can often be seen gazing into the distance with a dark, brooding expression, it’s fair to assume that he’s actually just daydreaming. 
Falken's second curriculum vitae is: Falken used to live in the mountains near Graywater, relying on hunting for subsistence.
When the Miracles arrived, the amount of livable space drastically decreased, putting a lot of pressure on the less-affluent.
Falken was left bewildered and perplexed by Sander’s betrayal, but it gave him a chance to reflect on the type of person he wanted to be. 
After getting established as an Ops Chief, he was compelled to forge his own path and form his own definition of justice in the aftermath of Sander’s defection.
After spending so many years alone, Falken could barely express the sense of safety that came from having someone at his back.
Although he refused to hide behind his allies, he came to terms with the fact that he needed them. He chose to put himself between them and any harm that could come their way. 
Falken's fourth curriculum vitae is: Falken’s interpersonal skills improved dramatically after joining the Esper Union. Falken, who was both handsome and dependable, became a trustworthy companion and attracted a lot of attention from his comrades.

He’s not going to give up on his brother and has been actively seeking ways to get his brother back to his side, all while upholding his Esper duties.

After a brief slump, Daylon managed to recover. Despite the criticisms of others, he continued on with his investigation into the cause of the attack. Finally, he discovered and destroyed the Shadow Decree's secret hideout outside the town.
That night, Daylon became the hero of the town. He was greeted with flowers and praise instead of doubt and reprimands. Through his diligent work, Daylon proved his suspicions were correct.
What did come as a surprise was the news that his twin brother had joined the Shadow Decree. He blamed himself, and for a while he struggled to be his usual, cheery self. 
It was only with the help of his family and friends that he was able to get back to normal.
He’s not going to give up on his brother and has been actively seeking ways to get his brother back to his side, all while upholding his Esper duties.
For the first time, Donar was able to gain the acceptance of his peers after that particular assignment, and he began to self-reflect. Instead of focused solely on himself, he began to prioritize the team's interests before his own. 
Donar's fourth curriculum vitae is: Despite the fact that following the rules was never Donar's strong point, he was promoted to Commander and given extra responsibilities. 
He used to charge into the fray without a second's hesitation, but he has since tempered his impulsive tendencies in favor of more measured approaches.

Djoser’s manly escapades are often punctuated by long periods of lonely introspection. When he’s in one of these moods, any passersby can catch a glimpse of him clutching two faded photographs. Djoser doesn’t talk about it, and his Decree brothers know better than to ask… everyone knows that these two photos are all that he has left of his wife and daughter.
Seeing the simple life of ordinary folks has helped Ashley to understand what it means to be someone who watches and helps when needed. Their gratitude and faith in Ashley rekindle her will to be a worthy commander.
Everyone has their own duty, and hers is to find trouble before it becomes a problem. It is only after they've been spotted can there be any possibility of solving them.
Ashley has re-embraced her passion to protect the citizens of Gyrate.
Laura still keeps a family photo at her desk in her bedroom. She would often look at the picture and get lost in her memories.

Laura's heroic ability is: Laura is a support Esper who grants a shield to all allies and counterattacks the attacker when her shield is destroyed or dispelled.

To her, the Esper Union will always be a group of self-serving do-gooders that can’t be relied upon.
Under their supposed leadership, the Miracle threat has not lessened, and more and more lives are lost each year to Miramon attacks.
In order to save the world, more drastic measures need to be taken.
Jeanne has found like-minded individuals in the Shadow Decree, people who are willing to go to any length to save humanity from extinction.
The Esper Union has already lost too much in their battle against the Miracles.
Human lives cannot be allowed to be lost if the human race is to survive. This is Pritzker’s guiding philosophy as both a director of the Esper Union and the head of the research department.
Under his leadership, more and more Union members are beginning to understand that Miracles can actually be used for the benefit of our species.
The Esper Union excelled at combating the Miramon threat. But, when dealing with lawbreakers and criminals, it was hampered by its own self-imposed rules and procedures. 
Crime and misconduct were often overlooked in these gray areas.
Although Lu Yi recognized that the Union needed to uphold regulations agreed upon with local authorities, he hated allowing criminals to escape due to technicalities. 
He ultimately decided not to join the Esper Union and to forge his own path to uphold justice.

She benefited from growing up in an extremely wealthy family where, as the heiress of the household, she was expected to look and play the part of a modern-day aristocrat. Life among the elite imbued her with a natural air of confidence.
To outsiders, Jin Yuyao may seem like a harsh, profiteering industrialist, but to her minions, however, she’s an idol to be worshipped and praised. 
Jin Yuyao's third curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s transformation from sweet-natured child to killer businesswoman has become a topic of fascination for many Esper enthusiasts and tabloid newspapers.
She was acutely aware of the Shadow Decree’s need for funding and independent financial networks, so she used her considerable business acumen to assemble a network of companies and conglomerates sharing interests diametrically opposed to those of the affluent Saunberts.
While the Saunbert family may have looked like untouchable tycoons, Jin Yuyao's time had come. 
She had put all of her pieces in place and patiently awaited the final act that would bring Abigail and her family to an end. Jin Yuyao's heroic ability is: Jin Yuyao is a powerful Support.
Jin Yuyao's hero god name is Queen Mother. Jin Yuyao's age is 26. Jin Yuyao's career is Shadow Pillager. Jin Yuyao's hobby is Beauty and cosmetics. Jin Yuyao's organization is Shadow. 
Jin Yuyao's first curriculum vitae is: Although endowed with extraordinary beauty and a ruthlessness ambition, few expected this young lady to acquire so much power. Jin Yuyao was able to establish a monopoly on the mining and trade of Nexus Crystals around the Super Miracle in a very short time.

She benefited from growing up in an extremely wealthy family where, as the heiress of the household, she was expected to look and play the part of a modern-day aristocrat. Life among the elite imbued her with a natural air of confidence.
To outsiders, Jin Yuyao may seem like a harsh, profiteering industrialist, but to her minions, however, she’s an idol to be worshipped and praised. 
Jin Yuyao's third curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s transformation from sweet-natured child to killer businesswoman has become a topic of fascination for many Esper enthusiasts and tabloid newspapers.
It’s not hard to get to the bottom of this mystery, however. If you look into Jin Yuyao’s past, you’ll quickly be drawn to “Abigail”, her family’s one-time ally and the cause of their later misfortunes.
When a lot of the family's company holdings were devalued as a result of the worldwide economic downturn, Jin Yuyao put her faith in her friend Abigail. She never imagined that Abigail would exploit this chance to seize control of the family's remaining assets.
There’s a saying on the Glory Plains: “one should never underestimate Jin Yuyao, the Scarlet Queen, the bane of mercenaries and bounty hunters alike.”
Any unfortunate soul who displeased Jin Yuyao would find themselves at the bitter end of an enchanted fan.
So great was Jin Yuyao’s feared reputation that the Shadow Decree sent their best envoys to try to recruit her. 
Jin Yuyao's second curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s penchant for cruelty is matched only by her air of sophistication.

With idealistic dreams and a lack of knowledge about the affairs behind the Union's split, Leora followed in Embla's footsteps and joined the Shadow Decree. She believed that the organization would rebuild a better version of the shattered world for all mankind.
The Shadow Decree reached out to Berenice several times in an attempt to win her over, but she refused each time. She has ceased meeting with them entirely.
Even though she has yet to become a Union Ops Chief, she will never associate herself with the Shadow Decree.
Berenice would climb to the top of her building every evening and gaze longingly toward Union HQ.
Within those hallowed halls are teachers she looks up to and a dream that was left unfulfilled.
What Berenice doesn’t realize is that all her friends and mentors are eagerly waiting for her fateful return.
Catherine's fourth curriculum vitae is: Catherine understands that the Shadow Decree is simply a temporary haven and not her true home. 
In her eyes, there is no such place.
Even though she sees the light of others, she’ll never feel their warmth.
She secretly yearns for it, but the world always blocks it out.
That’s why she won’t be able to stop her cruelty until the world is engulfed in darkness.

There’s a saying on the Glory Plains: “one should never underestimate Jin Yuyao, the Scarlet Queen, the bane of mercenaries and bounty hunters alike.”
Any unfortunate soul who displeased Jin Yuyao would find themselves at the bitter end of an enchanted fan.
So great was Jin Yuyao’s feared reputation that the Shadow Decree sent their best envoys to try to recruit her. 
Jin Yuyao's second curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s penchant for cruelty is matched only by her air of sophistication.
She was acutely aware of the Shadow Decree’s need for funding and independent financial networks, so she used her considerable business acumen to assemble a network of companies and conglomerates sharing interests diametrically opposed to those of the affluent Saunberts.
While the Saunbert family may have looked like untouchable tycoons, Jin Yuyao's time had come. 
She had put all of her pieces in place and patiently awaited the final act that would bring Abigail and her family to an end. Jin Yuyao's heroic ability is: Jin Yuyao is a powerful Support.
This unfortunate incident left a deep impression on Jin Yuyao. The betrayal had unleashed something very dark within her: the lust for revenge.
She vowed to reclaim all that was rightfully hers and enact her retribution. 
Jin Yuyao's fourth curriculum vitae is: The Burning of the Union marked the beginning of the Shadow Decree as a genuine independent power on Grandis.
This provided Jin Yuyao with a long-awaited opportunity to get revenge on Abigail and the wealthy Saunbert family. The time had come to reclaim everything that was rightfully hers.

The older gentleman made her realize that she had always had the power to choose her own destiny.
After breaking free from the shackles of her past, Cecilia found herself in a new world.  
Under Chu Yao’s guidance, she felt free for the first time, a queen in her own right.
Her heart swelled with gratitude, and she swore her allegiance to the man who had changed her life. 
The wall that Cecilia had built to isolate herself from the world wasn’t impenetrable after all.
Chu Yao had knocked a small crack into that wall.
Daniel's heroic description is: A man on a mission endowed with the celestial powers of Chiron.
Alice's hero god name is Gullveig. Alice's age is 27. Alice's career is Miracle Scholar. Alice's hobby is Crystals. 
Alice's first curriculum vitae is: You said there’s a fabulously dressed woman chanting some sort of incantation in a dark alley? Well, congrats! You might have just witnessed the famous witch who goes around spreading blessings. Name’s Alice.
There are rumors about a mysterious witch traveling near Miracles and helping those who have survived Miramon attacks with blessing spells.
Zhong Nan often replies with a laugh and a smile. If one buys him a drink, he will be more than happy to share what he knows. Be it hotspots in Utgard, popular restaurants, or must-buy souvenirs, he always has a tip for those visiting.
After a few drinks, he may even talk about the stories of his youth.
Born into a wealthy family,  Zhong Nan followed his father’s footsteps and became a marshal. Being young and proud back then, he did not understand the rules of the game in Utgard. He experienced a lot of setbacks and was forced to leave his hometown.

 Tiye is known for her mysterious and enigmatic behavior, as well as her periodic outbursts and ramblings about fortunes and constellations. 
========= 


=======source========
Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.
While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised.
Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel. 
Tiye's third curriculum vitae is: Tiye found a friend at the Academy who was ready to accept her and all of her eccentricities. Cheerful and inviting, Kaylee, was able to help Tiye connect with her fellow students.
Kaylee rose to prominence at the Academy as Tiye's friendly interpreter.
Tiye's second curriculum vitae is: Tiye's behavior stems from her disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood.
Her life changed forever when her family was attacked by a Miramon on their way to their new home. 
She saw the Miramon crush her father to death on the side of the road. Later, she witnessed the life leave her mother’s eyes as she succumbed to her injuries at the hospital.
She was too young to handle what she had encountered, and she fled to the deep recesses of her mind.

A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. Known information: Tiye's second curriculum vitae is: Tiye's behavior stems from her disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood.
Her life changed forever when her family was attacked by a Miramon on their way to their new home. 
She saw the Miramon crush her father to death on the side of the road. Later, she witnessed the life leave her mother’s eyes as she succumbed to her injuries at the hospital.
She was too young to handle what she had encountered, and she fled to the deep recesses of her mind.
Kaylee claims that her second short story is far easier to understand. Tiye knows in her heart that this is because reality had slowly started working its way into her idyllic fantasy universe.
Tiye secretly wonders if she should return to the real world, but deep down, she hopes she can stay in her fantasy forever. Tiye's heroic ability is: Tiye is a skillful Controller.
Nightbringer allows her to absorb an enemy’s Action Points while attacking them.
Starstruck applies Stun to all enemies. After ascension, this ability also inflicts SPD Down to all enemies.
Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel. 
Tiye's third curriculum vitae is: Tiye found a friend at the Academy who was ready to accept her and all of her eccentricities. Cheerful and inviting, Kaylee, was able to help Tiye connect with her fellow students.

Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.
While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised.

 Tiye's gift for fantasy manifests in her life as a coping mechanism to deal with the trauma she experienced during her childhood. She constructs a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the "Emissaries of the Miracles."

Of course, no one is perfect.
Kaylee does have her shortcomings. She has a short attention span and frequently forgets where she has left her belongings. 
If it weren’t for Tiye, she would be at the Logistics Division every week applying for replacements for her Union equipment. 
Kaylee's second curriculum vitae is: Kaylee, born into a loving family, learned sign language to better communicate with her sister, who was deaf.
Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.
While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised.

At the cabaret, Celine saw secret meetings and shady transactions taking place every night.
She waited patiently for the perfect opportunity to make her move. One night, she met the daughter of the powerful Saunbert family, Abigail. The two like-minded young women struck up a friendship, and a plan was devised. 
Under Abigail’s protection, Celine began using the cabaret as a front for her intelligence gathering operations. She discovered that many clients were willing to pay top dollar for her information.
In the end, Celine became Gyrate's Nightingale.
Whether it’s Lucas playing his air guitar for a non-existent audience or David suddenly breaking out into a weird dance, there’s no shortage of oddballs in the Union.
Despite his constant complaints about how crazy his colleagues are, he’s secretly relieved to be in a place where he belongs.
Q knows that behind the laughs and smiles, everyone at the Union has a troubled past.
Some of his antics aren’t just for his viewers, sometimes he genuinely wants to lighten the mood. He hopes his teammates know that he’ll always be by their side - through thick and thin.

Lauren still takes these sketches out and flips through them every now and again. They always bolster her determination in times of doubt and remind her that she is moving in the right direction.

Lauren is still on the front lines, delivering medical assistance to those who need it most. Lauren's heroic ability is: Lauren is a Support Esper who excels at healing teammates and boosting their Action Points.
Lauren’s Brush Of Vitality heals an ally and grants bonus Action Points. Her third ability, Healing Water, can either provide a large amount of healing to a selected ally or resurrect an already defeated ally, after which Lauren gains a bonus turn.
At the Union, she became a physician on the front lines. Saving lives is second nature to doctors, and she wanted to be where she could help the most people.

Regulars at the library are used to seeing this silent man walking around. No formal greeting is ever needed. There is a self-service and self-check-out system in place.
However, accidents sometimes do happen. When a book falls from one’s grasp, a pair of gloved hands would suddenly appear, catching the book and returning it to its owner. Even before thanks could be given, the shy librarian would vanished behind the shelves.
The Union members look at each other, then back to Ife sitting in the corner before leaving the lounge silently. They all know they should give the shy girl a moment to recover.

However, accidents sometimes do happen. When a book falls from one’s grasp, a pair of gloved hands would suddenly appear, catching the book and returning it to its owner. Even before thanks could be given, the shy librarian would vanished behind the shelves.
The Union members look at each other, then back to Ife sitting in the corner before leaving the lounge silently. They all know they should give the shy girl a moment to recover.
Ife actually wants to watch movies with the other Union members, but her anxiety often gets the better of her. Only when she is with her closest friends can she truly be herself.

 Tiye says that the stars always guide them to meet but also beckon them to leave in the same manner. 
=========

Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel. 
Tiye's third curriculum vitae is: Tiye found a friend at the Academy who was ready to accept her and all of her eccentricities. Cheerful and inviting, Kaylee, was able to help Tiye connect with her fellow students.
Kaylee rose to prominence at the Academy as Tiye's friendly interpreter.
Kaylee rose to prominence at the Academy as Tiye's friendly interpreter. 
Tiye would yell, "Allow the stars to guide you to your destiny, miserable souls!" Which Kaylee would clarify to the perplexed spectators: "Tiye was asking, are you in trouble? Let me help you."
As their friendship deepened, Kaylee and Tiye used their considerable free time at the Academy to write two fantasy novellas drawn directly from Tiye’s otherworldly ideas: "The Astral Chant" and "The Daughter of Fate."
Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.
While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised.

Lauren still takes these sketches out and flips through them every now and again. They always bolster her determination in times of doubt and remind her that she is moving in the right direction.
Only by remaining alive can one appreciate the world’s beauty.

Lauren’s Brush Of Vitality heals an ally and grants bonus Action Points. Her third ability, Healing Water, can either provide a large amount of healing to a selected ally or resurrect an already defeated ally, after which Lauren gains a bonus turn.
At the Union, she became a physician on the front lines. Saving lives is second nature to doctors, and she wanted to be where she could help the most people. 
Lauren has never forgotten what she set out to achieve, and as long as there is a glimmer of hope, she will do everything she can to keep her patients from dying. 
When she tells her patients to “keep holding on,” she’s also reminding herself.
Only by remaining alive can one appreciate the world’s beauty.

 Djoser has an extremely muscular body with broad shoulders and massive biceps.

Djoser's first curriculum vitae is: Anyone who catches a glimpse of Djoser's extremely broad shoulders and massive biceps instantly realizes that he’s not someone to be messed with. Never mind the fact that he wields a pair of blazing red axes.
You may ask, how can one obtain such a body? Djoser will tell you that there’s no great secret: three healthy meals a day is all it takes.
In addition to his “normal” exercise routine, he calculates his calories obsessively.
Djoser's third curriculum vitae is: Djoser was an orphan who spent his entire life feeling lost and alone. That was until he fell in love with his wife, with whom he had a beautiful daughter. He finally understood the meaning of having a family. 
His life felt complete, and he vowed to protect his family at all costs.
Unfortunately for him, fate had other plans. Tragically, his wife died soon after the birth of their daughter. He was so distraught that he was transformed into an Esper.
In addition to his “normal” exercise routine, he calculates his calories obsessively.
His daily diet consists of a bowl of quinoa rice, three servings of chicken breast, and two plates of broccoli. Later in the day he takes vitamin supplements, and has a bowl of cherry tomatoes. It’s basically everything a growing body needs.
You might well think that his meals don't seem particularly appetizing, you might be right, but Djoser understands how to prepare and season his dishes so that he has a different flavor every day. That way, he never gets bored.
