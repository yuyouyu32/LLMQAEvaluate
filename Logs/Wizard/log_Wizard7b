He began to question the meaning of being an Esper Union hero, and it took him a long time to sort out his thoughts.

Known information: Crime and misconduct were often overlooked in these gray areas.
Although Lu Yi recognized that the Union needed to uphold regulations agreed upon with local authorities, he hated allowing criminals to escape due to technicalities. 
He ultimately decided not to join the Esper Union and to forge his own path to uphold justice. Perhaps not even Pritzker could have foreseen that his protege would one day betray the Esper Union.
When he saw his former student, Hyde, delving into an increasingly dangerous experiment, he made the decision to halt the project.
However, Hyde didn’t reflect on his actions. Instead, he left the Union and joined the Shadow Decree to continue his illicit research.
Pritzker wasn’t just disappointed in his student, worse still, he felt that he had failed as a mentor. He realized that life was not about revenge and that art should never be used as a weapon. He began to wonder what type of person he wanted to become.
His answer ultimately led him to join the Esper Union.
He wanted to use his powers for good rather than staying trapped in the past. The Esper Union has already lost too much in their battle against the Miracles.
Human lives cannot be allowed to be lost if the human race is to survive. This is Pritzker’s guiding philosophy as both a director of the Esper Union and the head of the research department.
Under his leadership, more and more Union members are beginning to understand that Miracles can actually be used for the benefit of our species.

Known information: The Esper Union has already lost too much in their battle against the Miracles.
Human lives cannot be allowed to be lost if the human race is to survive. This is Pritzker’s guiding philosophy as both a director of the Esper Union and the head of the research department.
Under his leadership, more and more Union members are beginning to understand that Miracles can actually be used for the benefit of our species. Perhaps not even Pritzker could have foreseen that his protege would one day betray the Esper Union.
When he saw his former student, Hyde, delving into an increasingly dangerous experiment, he made the decision to halt the project.
However, Hyde didn’t reflect on his actions. Instead, he left the Union and joined the Shadow Decree to continue his illicit research.
Pritzker wasn’t just disappointed in his student, worse still, he felt that he had failed as a mentor. Crime and misconduct were often overlooked in these gray areas.
Although Lu Yi recognized that the Union needed to uphold regulations agreed upon with local authorities, he hated allowing criminals to escape due to technicalities. 
He ultimately decided not to join the Esper Union and to forge his own path to uphold justice. Fame has turned Ahmed’s life upside down. A life of hardship and suffering is suddenly flooded with adoring fans and international recognition. He is sometimes overwhelmed by this transformation.
Although Ahmed is not the talkative type and appears aloof most of the time, he really wants to make friends at the Esper Union.

Known information: She benefited from growing up in an extremely wealthy family where, as the heiress of the household, she was expected to look and play the part of a modern-day aristocrat. Life among the elite imbued her with a natural air of confidence.
To outsiders, Jin Yuyao may seem like a harsh, profiteering industrialist, but to her minions, however, she’s an idol to be worshipped and praised. When a lot of the family's company holdings were devalued as a result of the worldwide economic downturn, Jin Yuyao put her faith in her friend Abigail. She never imagined that Abigail would exploit this chance to seize control of the family's remaining assets.
This unfortunate incident left a deep impression on Jin Yuyao. The betrayal had unleashed something very dark within her: the lust for revenge.
She vowed to reclaim all that was rightfully hers and enact her retribution. There’s a saying on the Glory Plains: “one should never underestimate Jin Yuyao, the Scarlet Queen, the bane of mercenaries and bounty hunters alike.”
Any unfortunate soul who displeased Jin Yuyao would find themselves at the bitter end of an enchanted fan.
So great was Jin Yuyao’s feared reputation that the Shadow Decree sent their best envoys to try to recruit her. 
Jin Yuyao's second curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s penchant for cruelty is matched only by her air of sophistication. Jin Yuyao's hero god name is Queen Mother. Jin Yuyao's age is 26. Jin Yuyao's career is Shadow Pillager. Jin Yuyao's hobby is Beauty and cosmetics. Jin Yuyao's organization is Shadow. 
Jin Yuyao's first curriculum vitae is: Although endowed with extraordinary beauty and a ruthlessness ambition, few expected this young lady to acquire so much power. Jin Yuyao was able to establish a monopoly on the mining and trade of Nexus Crystals around the Super Miracle in a very short time.

You might have just witnessed the famous witch who goes around spreading blessings. Name’s Alice. Lynn is an emotionally sensitive young lady who finds joy in the simplest things in life. 
She is indifferent to the power struggle between the Shadow Decree and the Esper Union, and just yearns for peace and stability.
The threat of the Miracles, as well as humanity’s struggle for survival, has taken precedence over her own desires. 
Nonetheless, between bouts of battle, Lynn takes advantage of the few moments of peace to enjoy the natural world around her. At the cabaret, Celine saw secret meetings and shady transactions taking place every night.
She waited patiently for the perfect opportunity to make her move. One night, she met the daughter of the powerful Saunbert family, Abigail. The two like-minded young women struck up a friendship, and a plan was devised. Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”

LLM_Input:
Known information: Tiye's hero god name is Nut. Tiye's age is 18. Tiye's career is Ops Chief. Tiye's hobby is Fantasy. Tiye's organization is Dawn. 
Tiye's first curriculum vitae is: Tiye has always been something of a mystery wrapped in an enigma stuffed into a conundrum. Her classmates and colleagues at the Esper Union Academy could never make heads or tails of what she was saying. Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel. While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised. 
Tiye's second curriculum vitae is: Tiye's behavior stems from her disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood.
Her life changed forever when her family was attacked by a Miramon on their way to their new home. Tiye remains extremely proud of her publications, "The Astral Chant" and "The Daughter of Fate". She still reads “The Daughter of Fate” religiously to refresh her memory of where her mind was at.
Kaylee claims that her second short story is far easier to understand. Tiye knows in her heart that this is because reality had slowly started working its way into her idyllic fantasy universe.

 Lauren, Tiye, and Stewart are sharing drinks and stories in the Union lounge.

LLM_Input:
Known information: Whether it’s Lucas playing his air guitar for a non-existent audience or David suddenly breaking out into a weird dance, there’s no shortage of oddballs in the Union.

Q knows that behind the laughs and smiles, everyone at the Union has a troubled past. The Union members look at each other, then back to Ife sitting in the corner before leaving the lounge silently. They all know they should give the shy girl a moment to recover.
Ife actually wants to watch movies with the other Union members, but her anxiety often gets the better of her. Only when she is with her closest friends can she truly be herself. Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos. Under Abigail’s protection, Celine began using the cabaret as a front for her intelligence gathering operations. She discovered that many clients were willing to pay top dollar for her information.
In the end, Celine became Gyrate's Nightingale. 
Celine's fourth curriculum vitae is: Evening Sounds’ doors are always open to those in need, for the right price.
Celine understands that human interaction is transactional, nothing more. Today’s friend could easily become tomorrow’s foe.
