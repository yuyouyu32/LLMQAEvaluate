However, Raven was able to mold Donar into a dependable and patient member of the Esper Union over time. 
During an important mission in which Raven was not there to lead, Donar did not charge blindly to the front but instead waited to observe and assess the situation. He took action only when the necessary safety precautions were taken.
His job as an Esper Union Ops Chief allows him to do what he loves to do. He gets to be on the frontlines and hone his fighting skills. 
Protecting and safeguarding the people around him has always been a prerogative in his life. 
There are also a few perks to the job, such as giving street thugs lessons in manners. If they don’t listen, he gets to punch them in the face (although his superiors and HR have reprimanded him several times for such behavior).
He used to charge into the fray without a second's hesitation, but he has since tempered his impulsive tendencies in favor of more measured approaches.

Rescue and construction operations each play important roles in the Esper Union. This seemingly simple job is about providing safety and security to the people.

Crime and misconduct were often overlooked in these gray areas.
Although Lu Yi recognized that the Union needed to uphold regulations agreed upon with local authorities, he hated allowing criminals to escape due to technicalities. 
He ultimately decided not to join the Esper Union and to forge his own path to uphold justice.
Perhaps not even Pritzker could have foreseen that his protege would one day betray the Esper Union.
When he saw his former student, Hyde, delving into an increasingly dangerous experiment, he made the decision to halt the project.
However, Hyde didn’t reflect on his actions. Instead, he left the Union and joined the Shadow Decree to continue his illicit research.
Pritzker wasn’t just disappointed in his student, worse still, he felt that he had failed as a mentor.
He realized that life was not about revenge and that art should never be used as a weapon. He began to wonder what type of person he wanted to become.
His answer ultimately led him to join the Esper Union.
He wanted to use his powers for good rather than staying trapped in the past.
The Esper Union has already lost too much in their battle against the Miracles.
Human lives cannot be allowed to be lost if the human race is to survive. This is Pritzker’s guiding philosophy as both a director of the Esper Union and the head of the research department.
Under his leadership, more and more Union members are beginning to understand that Miracles can actually be used for the benefit of our species.

All of the divine powers in the world couldn’t help her out of her predicament.
Grateful for Luo Yan’s help, Lin Xiao became his second in command. He was pleased to see that, under his supervision, the young lady had become less rash and more analytical in her behavior.
Although Lin Xiao had calmed with time, the older mentor would still take a few steps back every time his younger colleague rushed forward to greet him excitedly.
The whole affair drove her to leave the Utgard arena and all the honors that came with it.
Determined to expand her horizons, she chose to follow Luo Yan into the world outside the fighting pits. 
Lin Xiao's fourth curriculum vitae is: Some say justice delayed is justice denied.
Lin Xiao knows that being proven innocent is what matters the most in the end.
Luo Yan taught her that upholding justice requires no justification.

“Mayor Abigail, congratulations on winning the election,” several guests call out to her. Abigail nods slightly and raise her glass to the guests who have been waiting to get her attention.
 
As the head of House Saunbert, Abigail has gotten used to such situations. Be it the obvious flattery or the whispered gossip behind her back, Abigail has always managed to keep her composure.
For the first time, Donar was able to gain the acceptance of his peers after that particular assignment, and he began to self-reflect. Instead of focused solely on himself, he began to prioritize the team's interests before his own. 
Donar's fourth curriculum vitae is: Despite the fact that following the rules was never Donar's strong point, he was promoted to Commander and given extra responsibilities.
They burst into laughter whenever they meet at their old diner in the snowfields. It may be a mockery of fate or a destined reunion, but whatever it is, they always toast one another when they meet. 
Zhong Nan's fourth curriculum vitae is: Although Zhong Nan’s misfortunes have erased his youthful enthusiasm, he never complains. Like Aurelius, this lonely wanderer is hiding something deep in himself. He wishes he could change things but, at the same time, feels powerless to do so.
What did come as a surprise was the news that his twin brother had joined the Shadow Decree. He blamed himself, and for a while he struggled to be his usual, cheery self. 
It was only with the help of his family and friends that he was able to get back to normal.
He’s not going to give up on his brother and has been actively seeking ways to get his brother back to his side, all while upholding his Esper duties.

Despite witnessing the ugliness of the world, Ashley still chooses to believe in the good of people.
After all, not everything she sees is unbearable. A long-awaited reunion at the train station, a couple walking hand-in-hand at the market, children playing in the park... The joys of normal life give Ashley the strength to persevere.
Djoser’s manly escapades are often punctuated by long periods of lonely introspection. When he’s in one of these moods, any passersby can catch a glimpse of him clutching two faded photographs. Djoser doesn’t talk about it, and his Decree brothers know better than to ask… everyone knows that these two photos are all that he has left of his wife and daughter.
But recently, the convenience store's freezer has been hiding some unremarkable yet exorbitantly priced types of ice cream. They have been depleting Yuuhime's wallet, eliciting a barely perceptible change in her typically stoic demeanor.
Suddenly, Yuuhime's phone rings and her face darkens as she heads out to find her next target.
Whether it’s Lucas playing his air guitar for a non-existent audience or David suddenly breaking out into a weird dance, there’s no shortage of oddballs in the Union.
Despite his constant complaints about how crazy his colleagues are, he’s secretly relieved to be in a place where he belongs.
Q knows that behind the laughs and smiles, everyone at the Union has a troubled past.

The Esper Union has already lost too much in their battle against the Miracles.
Human lives cannot be allowed to be lost if the human race is to survive. This is Pritzker’s guiding philosophy as both a director of the Esper Union and the head of the research department.
Under his leadership, more and more Union members are beginning to understand that Miracles can actually be used for the benefit of our species.
Perhaps not even Pritzker could have foreseen that his protege would one day betray the Esper Union.
When he saw his former student, Hyde, delving into an increasingly dangerous experiment, he made the decision to halt the project.
However, Hyde didn’t reflect on his actions. Instead, he left the Union and joined the Shadow Decree to continue his illicit research.
Pritzker wasn’t just disappointed in his student, worse still, he felt that he had failed as a mentor.
Crime and misconduct were often overlooked in these gray areas.
Although Lu Yi recognized that the Union needed to uphold regulations agreed upon with local authorities, he hated allowing criminals to escape due to technicalities. 
He ultimately decided not to join the Esper Union and to forge his own path to uphold justice.
Fame has turned Ahmed’s life upside down. A life of hardship and suffering is suddenly flooded with adoring fans and international recognition. He is sometimes overwhelmed by this transformation.
Although Ahmed is not the talkative type and appears aloof most of the time, he really wants to make friends at the Esper Union.

She was acutely aware of the Shadow Decree’s need for funding and independent financial networks, so she used her considerable business acumen to assemble a network of companies and conglomerates sharing interests diametrically opposed to those of the affluent Saunberts.
While the Saunbert family may have looked like untouchable tycoons, Jin Yuyao's time had come.
She benefited from growing up in an extremely wealthy family where, as the heiress of the household, she was expected to look and play the part of a modern-day aristocrat. Life among the elite imbued her with a natural air of confidence.
To outsiders, Jin Yuyao may seem like a harsh, profiteering industrialist, but to her minions, however, she’s an idol to be worshipped and praised.
Jin Yuyao's hero god name is Queen Mother. Jin Yuyao's age is 26. Jin Yuyao's career is Shadow Pillager. Jin Yuyao's hobby is Beauty and cosmetics. Jin Yuyao's organization is Shadow. 
Jin Yuyao's first curriculum vitae is: Although endowed with extraordinary beauty and a ruthlessness ambition, few expected this young lady to acquire so much power. Jin Yuyao was able to establish a monopoly on the mining and trade of Nexus Crystals around the Super Miracle in a very short time.
When a lot of the family's company holdings were devalued as a result of the worldwide economic downturn, Jin Yuyao put her faith in her friend Abigail. She never imagined that Abigail would exploit this chance to seize control of the family's remaining assets.
This unfortunate incident left a deep impression on Jin Yuyao. The betrayal had unleashed something very dark within her: the lust for revenge.
She vowed to reclaim all that was rightfully hers and enact her retribution.

There’s a saying on the Glory Plains: “one should never underestimate Jin Yuyao, the Scarlet Queen, the bane of mercenaries and bounty hunters alike.”
Any unfortunate soul who displeased Jin Yuyao would find themselves at the bitter end of an enchanted fan.

To outsiders, Jin Yuyao may seem like a harsh, profiteering industrialist, but to her minions, however, she’s an idol to be worshipped and praised.
She was acutely aware of the Shadow Decree’s need for funding and independent financial networks, so she used her considerable business acumen to assemble a network of companies and conglomerates sharing interests diametrically opposed to those of the affluent Saunberts.
While the Saunbert family may have looked like untouchable tycoons, Jin Yuyao's time had come.
Jin Yuyao's third curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s transformation from sweet-natured child to killer businesswoman has become a topic of fascination for many Esper enthusiasts and tabloid newspapers.
It’s not hard to get to the bottom of this mystery, however. If you look into Jin Yuyao’s past, you’ll quickly be drawn to “Abigail”, her family’s one-time ally and the cause of their later misfortunes.

Jin Yuyao's hero god name is Queen Mother. Jin Yuyao's age is 26. Jin Yuyao's career is Shadow Pillager. Jin Yuyao's hobby is Beauty and cosmetics. Jin Yuyao's organization is Shadow. 
Jin Yuyao's first curriculum vitae is: Although endowed with extraordinary beauty and a ruthlessness ambition, few expected this young lady to acquire so much power. Jin Yuyao was able to establish a monopoly on the mining and trade of Nexus Crystals around the Super Miracle in a very short time.
She benefited from growing up in an extremely wealthy family where, as the heiress of the household, she was expected to look and play the part of a modern-day aristocrat. Life among the elite imbued her with a natural air of confidence.
To outsiders, Jin Yuyao may seem like a harsh, profiteering industrialist, but to her minions, however, she’s an idol to be worshipped and praised.
Jin Yuyao's third curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s transformation from sweet-natured child to killer businesswoman has become a topic of fascination for many Esper enthusiasts and tabloid newspapers.
It’s not hard to get to the bottom of this mystery, however. If you look into Jin Yuyao’s past, you’ll quickly be drawn to “Abigail”, her family’s one-time ally and the cause of their later misfortunes.
On her turn, she can cast Mount Kunlun’s Rage to dispel all buffs on her targets. Upon successful dispelling, she reduces the targets’ AP. She can also transfer team-wide debuffs to her targets and deal damage based on her max HP.
Jin Yuyao's heroic description is: Jin Yuyao's fortunes may have declined substantially, but she is determined to climb her way back to the top with the Queen Mother's extraordinary help.

Jin Yuyao's first curriculum vitae is: Although endowed with extraordinary beauty and a ruthlessness ambition, few expected this young lady to acquire so much power. Jin Yuyao was able to establish a monopoly on the mining and trade of Nexus Crystals around the Super Miracle in a very short time.
She vowed to reclaim all that was rightfully hers and enact her retribution. 
Jin Yuyao's fourth curriculum vitae is: The Burning of the Union marked the beginning of the Shadow Decree as a genuine independent power on Grandis.
This provided Jin Yuyao with a long-awaited opportunity to get revenge on Abigail and the wealthy Saunbert family. The time had come to reclaim everything that was rightfully hers.
Jin Yuyao's third curriculum vitae is: Jin Yuyao’s transformation from sweet-natured child to killer businesswoman has become a topic of fascination for many Esper enthusiasts and tabloid newspapers.
It’s not hard to get to the bottom of this mystery, however. If you look into Jin Yuyao’s past, you’ll quickly be drawn to “Abigail”, her family’s one-time ally and the cause of their later misfortunes.

Jin Yuyao's hero god name is Queen Mother. Jin Yuyao's age is 26. Jin Yuyao's career is Shadow Pillager. Jin Yuyao's hobby is Beauty and cosmetics. Jin Yuyao's organization is Shadow. 
Jin Yuyao's first curriculum vitae is: Although endowed with extraordinary beauty and a ruthlessness ambition, few expected this young lady to acquire so much power. Jin Yuyao was able to establish a monopoly on the mining and trade of Nexus Crystals around the Super Miracle in a very short time.

Daniel's heroic description is: A man on a mission endowed with the celestial powers of Chiron.
Alice's hero god name is Gullveig. Alice's age is 27. Alice's career is Miracle Scholar. Alice's hobby is Crystals. 
Alice's first curriculum vitae is: You said there’s a fabulously dressed woman chanting some sort of incantation in a dark alley? Well, congrats! You might have just witnessed the famous witch who goes around spreading blessings. Name’s Alice.
Lynn is an emotionally sensitive young lady who finds joy in the simplest things in life. 
She is indifferent to the power struggle between the Shadow Decree and the Esper Union, and just yearns for peace and stability.
The threat of the Miracles, as well as humanity’s struggle for survival, has taken precedence over her own desires. 
Nonetheless, between bouts of battle, Lynn takes advantage of the few moments of peace to enjoy the natural world around her.
At the cabaret, Celine saw secret meetings and shady transactions taking place every night.
She waited patiently for the perfect opportunity to make her move. One night, she met the daughter of the powerful Saunbert family, Abigail. The two like-minded young women struck up a friendship, and a plan was devised.
Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel.

 Tiye is known for her mysterious and enigmatic behavior, as well as her periodic outbursts and ramblings about fortunes and constellations. 
========= 


=======source========
Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.
While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised. 
Tiye's second curriculum vitae is: Tiye's behavior stems from her disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood.
Her life changed forever when her family was attacked by a Miramon on their way to their new home.
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel. 
Tiye's third curriculum vitae is: Tiye found a friend at the Academy who was ready to accept her and all of her eccentricities. Cheerful and inviting, Kaylee, was able to help Tiye connect with her fellow students.
Kaylee rose to prominence at the Academy as Tiye's friendly interpreter.
Tiye's hero god name is Nut. Tiye's age is 18. Tiye's career is Ops Chief. Tiye's hobby is Fantasy. Tiye's organization is Dawn. 
Tiye's first curriculum vitae is: Tiye has always been something of a mystery wrapped in an enigma stuffed into a conundrum. Her classmates and colleagues at the Esper Union Academy could never make heads or tails of what she was saying.

Tiye remains extremely proud of her publications, "The Astral Chant" and "The Daughter of Fate". She still reads “The Daughter of Fate” religiously to refresh her memory of where her mind was at.
Kaylee claims that her second short story is far easier to understand. Tiye knows in her heart that this is because reality had slowly started working its way into her idyllic fantasy universe.
Tiye clung to this piece of make-believe until, one day, it began to unravel. 
Tiye's third curriculum vitae is: Tiye found a friend at the Academy who was ready to accept her and all of her eccentricities. Cheerful and inviting, Kaylee, was able to help Tiye connect with her fellow students.
Kaylee rose to prominence at the Academy as Tiye's friendly interpreter.

While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised. 
Tiye's second curriculum vitae is: Tiye's behavior stems from her disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood.
Her life changed forever when her family was attacked by a Miramon on their way to their new home.
Rather than facing reality, Tiye constructed a fantasy in which her parents were intergalactic warriors who had passed their final test and had been escorted away to the center of the universe by the “Emissaries of the Miracles.”

Their major triumph came when they had the short stories published and distributed among the faculty and students of the Academy. Unfortunately, the books were rather incomprehensible to everyone, with the exception of Kaylee. 
Tiye's fourth curriculum vitae is: As the years went by, reality started to bleed through into her fantasy world. It all began with her novellas.

Tiye's first curriculum vitae is: Tiye has always been something of a mystery wrapped in an enigma stuffed into a conundrum. Her classmates and colleagues at the Esper Union Academy could never make heads or tails of what she was saying.
While Tiye has always claimed that she is the actual center of the universe, Academy officials don’t seem to agree. They’ve always been more than happy to keep her out of sight when public events are scheduled and televised. 
Tiye's second curriculum vitae is: Tiye's behavior stems from her disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood.
Her life changed forever when her family was attacked by a Miramon on their way to their new home.
Tiye secretly wonders if she should return to the real world, but deep down, she hopes she can stay in her fantasy forever. Tiye's heroic ability is: Tiye is a skillful Controller.
Nightbringer allows her to absorb an enemy’s Action Points while attacking them.
Starstruck applies Stun to all enemies. After ascension, this ability also inflicts SPD Down to all enemies.
Devouring Void steals Action Points from all enemy targets and distributes it equally among allies.
Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.

 Nut's blessing has a significant impact on Tiye's life. As a hero goddess, Nut bestows Tiye with the self-confidence befitting the "Center of the Universe."

Tiye's disconnect with reality, which has its roots in a serious trauma she suffered during her childhood, is a result of her connection with Nut. This trauma has led to her belief that she is the actual center of the universe, and Nut's blessing reinforces this belief.

Furthermore, Nut's blessing enhances Tiye's natural talents as a Controller. Her heroic ability, Devouring Void, steals Action Points from all enemy targets and distributes it equally among allies, making her a valuable asset in battle.

Overall, Nut's blessing has a profound impact on Tiye's life, shaping her worldview and strengthening her abilities as a hero.

Whether it’s Lucas playing his air guitar for a non-existent audience or David suddenly breaking out into a weird dance, there’s no shortage of oddballs in the Union.
Despite his constant complaints about how crazy his colleagues are, he’s secretly relieved to be in a place where he belongs.
Q knows that behind the laughs and smiles, everyone at the Union has a troubled past.
The Union members look at each other, then back to Ife sitting in the corner before leaving the lounge silently. They all know they should give the shy girl a moment to recover.
Ife actually wants to watch movies with the other Union members, but her anxiety often gets the better of her. Only when she is with her closest friends can she truly be herself.
Her periodic outbursts in the Academy halls never helped her cause either. It’s not uncommon to find Tiye on top of the water tower, rambling about how our fortunes are linked to the constellations.
That’s the reason this star Esper student has never been featured in any official Union Academy advertisements or promotional videos.
Under Abigail’s protection, Celine began using the cabaret as a front for her intelligence gathering operations. She discovered that many clients were willing to pay top dollar for her information.
In the end, Celine became Gyrate's Nightingale. 
Celine's fourth curriculum vitae is: Evening Sounds’ doors are always open to those in need, for the right price.
Celine understands that human interaction is transactional, nothing more. Today’s friend could easily become tomorrow’s foe.

Laura was concerned that Odette was consumed by hatred. Yet she stubbornly pushed Laura away.
When Odette found herself in danger and trapped in the enemy’s camp, it was Laura who arrived just in time to save her.

In the end, Odette managed to capture her parents’ killers, resisting the temptation to kill them on the spot. With that, she was able to put her tragic past behind her.

While conversing with the flora and the fauna, she often picks up all sorts of weird stories and gossip from her photosynthesizing friends. 
The plants are as important to her as family. 
She despises all those who would do them harm, so make sure you don’t serve her fresh fruit juice or vegetable smoothies, and watch what you say when you’re out with her.
On special occasions, such as birthdays and anniversaries, her colleagues would receive a gorgeous potted plant on their desk accompanied by a small card in Chang Pu’s handwriting. 
The front of the card would include well wishes, and the back would include detailed instructions on how to properly care for the plant.
Yi An, her father – whom she adores with all her heart – his workstation is completely adorned with such miniature potted plants and greeting cards.
Asenath's third curriculum vitae is: As the years went by, Asenath's connection with plants became even stronger. She grew to even sense the timeless memories of the ancient trees she came into contact with.
These transcendent experiences gave her the resolve to leave Debia. She set out to explore the entirety of the land, and learn of its complex history through its ancient flora.
In her spare time, she likes to knit. It was a hobby she shared with her late beloved.
Knitting allows her to reminisce about a simpler time when she was younger and didn’t have the weight of the world on her shoulders. 
During the holidays, she knits mittens and scarves for her students and colleagues.
Sienna treasures these moments of quiet tranquility because she has firsthand knowledge of the world’s suffering and cruelty.

 Djoser has an extremely muscular body with broad shoulders and massive biceps. 
========= 


=======source========
Djoser's hero god name is Atum. Djoser's age is 40. Djoser's career is Shadow Guard. Djoser's hobby is Healthy eating. Djoser's organization is Shadow. 
Djoser's first curriculum vitae is: Anyone who catches a glimpse of Djoser's extremely broad shoulders and massive biceps instantly realizes that he’s not someone to be messed with. Never mind the fact that he wields a pair of blazing red axes.
Djoser's third curriculum vitae is: Djoser was an orphan who spent his entire life feeling lost and alone. That was until he fell in love with his wife, with whom he had a beautiful daughter. He finally understood the meaning of having a family. 
His life felt complete, and he vowed to protect his family at all costs.
Unfortunately for him, fate had other plans. Tragically, his wife died soon after the birth of their daughter. He was so distraught that he was transformed into an Esper.
While most people see him as an unstoppable juggernaut, he is really just a man who longs for his family. Djoser's heroic ability is: Djoser is a Defender who is also good at dealing damage.
Eternal Strength inflicts Diseased when Djoser has Bull Rage. After ascension, each attack grants him Bull Rage. Bull Rage continuously increases his DEF and RESIST. When inflicted with a debuff other than Incapacitation, he has a chance of consuming 1 Bull Rage stack to ignore this debuff.
You may ask, how can one obtain such a body? Djoser will tell you that there’s no great secret: three healthy meals a day is all it takes.
In addition to his “normal” exercise routine, he calculates his calories obsessively.
His daily diet consists of a bowl of quinoa rice, three servings of chicken breast, and two plates of broccoli. Later in the day he takes vitamin supplements, and has a bowl of cherry tomatoes. It’s basically everything a growing body needs.
